                        Though mentioned in several Norse sagas, the rules for this Scandenavian tafl game were
                        never explicitly recorded. This is just one of many reconstructed variants.

                        The best documented tafl game, Tablut was played well into the 18th century and its rules served
                        as the basis for later tafl reconstructions. Originating in Sweden, the pieces were referred to
                        as "Swedes and Russains".
